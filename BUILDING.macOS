To make it on macOS you'll need installed:

0. XCode installed
1. cmake(install it via brew)
2. SDL2 - download it from official site and place into /Library/Frameworks/ directory
3. QT5

Fix QT5 path in mac_build.sh and run it.

It builds version with targetting to macOS 10.13(last supported version) - you'll get 
application and installation image in build directory.
